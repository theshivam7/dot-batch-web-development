        <h3>Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The project focuses on developing an ML model that can predict the risk of cardiovascular disease using key risk factors collected from users.</li>
            <li>The ML model is initially trained using Logistic Regression based on a real dataset obtained from Kaggle.</li>
            <li>As the model achieved an accuracy of 80%, it was saved as a .sav file and deployed using the Streamlit framework for an initial prototype.</li>
